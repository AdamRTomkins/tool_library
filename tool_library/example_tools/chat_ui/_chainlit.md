# Kalavai Personal AI Assistant

Your very own A assistant to help you navigate documents. This is **not your typical, hyper-verbose LLM**. KalavAI Assistant is designed to speed up document navigation by allowing you to _talk to your documents_. It gives you a leg up to:
- Unpack the details of a case study in seconds, not minutes
- Get answers to mock exams based on the material covered in class
- Clarify concepts and fight the fog of acronyms


## Getting Started

Upload your documents using the chat box below and **ask anything**.


## How it works?

When you upload a document, Kalavai reads, ingests and stores it in its memory. When you ask questions, the Assistant refers back to the bank of documents you've previously provided and **forms its answer based only on relevant information**. This is a key different with services like ChatGPT or Claude 2. We won't make up facts. If your request cannot be answered with the documents available, we'll say so!   


## How to get the best of KalavAI?

KalavAI uses a method called **RAG (Retriever Augmented Generation)**, which uses LLMs to write answers by first fetching relevant information from documents and use them in the LLM prompt. Thus, the best way to get answers is by making sure the question you are asking is good enough to match against the context that contains the answer. Simply put, use _google-like_ techniques in your input: include important keywords and contextualise the question. 

Example of poor question:

_"What are the pros and cons of the strategy in the case"_

Example of good question:

_"In the Swatch case, what are the pros and cons of the strategy applied?"_
