# Kalavai Personal AI Assistant

This is **not your typical, hyper-verbose LLM**. KalavAI Assistant is designed to allow you to _talk to your documents_. To get started, simply upload documents using the chat box below and **ask anything**.

## How to get the best of KalavAI?


When you ask questions, the Assistant refers back to the content you've previously provided and **forms its answer based only on relevant information**. We won't make up facts. If your request cannot be answered with the documents available, we'll say so!

KalavAI uses a method called **RAG (Retriever Augmented Generation)**, which uses LLMs to write answers by first fetching relevant information from documents and use them in the LLM prompt. The best way to get answers is by ensuring the question is good enough to match against the context that contains the answer. Think _search engine_; if you could find the context with your question in Google, then it's a good one!

Example of poor question:

_"What are the pros and cons of the strategy in the case"_

Example of good question:

_"In the Swatch case, what are the pros and cons of the strategy applied?"_
