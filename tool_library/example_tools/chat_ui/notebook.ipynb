Under Berkwelsh’s ownership, \\r\\nShoeCreatures was able to make independent strategic moves. ShoeCreatures decided to \\r\\nstop competing with its larger, established competitors and decided to refocus only into \\r\\nrunning products, which include shoes, clothing and accessories. As part of this new \\r\\nstrategic intent, ShoeCreatures concentrated on it’s The Lion shoes while developing\\r\\ntechnology for alternative running products, resulting in the creation of the The Cheetah, \\r\\ngeared toward runners with normal feet. ShoeCreatures aimed to be the exclusive running \\r\\nbrand and expanded its product line to satisfy runners of all ages and styles. Rather than\\r\\nspending on advertising, ShoeCreatures went straight to runners’ feet. By sending sales \\r\\nrepresentatives to specialty running stores, the company built relationships with these \\r\\nstores and connected directly with its target consumers. They also travelled to \\r\\nindependent running events, college campuses, and had specialized “running gurus” in \\r\\ncertain stores. Through its new strategy, ShoeCreatures made developments that were \\r\\nimpossible for larger brands competing in multiple athletic categories (i.e., beyond \\r\\nrunning) to replicate.

The \\r\\nproduct was of high quality and customers were willing to pay high prices. It was also \\r\\nonly available in specialized running stores instead of large athletic chain stores. Led by \\r\\nthis new product, ShoeCreatures became one of the top three shoe brands by the 1970s. \\r\\nHowever, the success was short-lived as larger companies such as Nike and more \\r\\nnewcomers started to squeeze the market. With increasing competition, ShoeCreatures\\r\\nwas left overexposed to business downturn, leading to financial difficulties. \\r\\nShoeCreatures began cutting costs by sacrificing quality, utilizing cheaper materials in \\r\\nthe designing and manufacturing of its footwear, lowering prices to regain customers, and \\r\\neven at times distributing its products to discount chain stores with retail prices as low as \\r\\n$20—a significant decrease from its earlier $90 pricing point.\\r\\nDeclining in the athletic industry, ShoeCreatures was acquired by Antarctica in 1982. \\r\\nAntarctica was a large apparel company that had traditionally relied on acquisition \\r\\nstrategies to expand.
